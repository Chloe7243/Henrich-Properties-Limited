                           other aspects of your life. Our approach starts with establishing a
                           two-way relationship with each client. We believe that a successful
                           advisor-client relationship develops when both sense that they can
                           and will work well together. We spend quite a bit of time with
                           prospective clients making sure that there is a good fit. So our
                           involvement with clients particularly for those services that
                           anticipate a long-term involvement or will over time result in
                           life-changing decisions begins with face-to-face meetings designed
                           to ensure that there is a meeting of the minds and a real sense of
                           trust. Client service is at the core of what we do. Industry studies
                           and our own experiences have shown that the two central tenets of
                           financial advisory services are to be accessible and keep your
                           client informed through appropriate levels of communication.
